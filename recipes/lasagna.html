            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.

            In a 9"x13" baking dish, add thin layer of meat sauce to the bottom of the dish. Arrange 6 lasagna noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread ricotta cheese mixture and top with mozzarella slices. Add another thin layer of meat sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
        </li>

            Repeat the layering process and top with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Spray a sheet of foil with cooking spray and cover the baking dish.
